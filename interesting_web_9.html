                  This website is simply someone's blog.
                  The reason that it is so interesting to me is because blogs of this nature typically don't exist anymore.
                  I was surprised to stumble across a whole website dedicated to someone's ramblings when googling something else. 
                  It doesn't even really have a homepage, but once you end up on a random entry from a search engine, there is a menu where you can click on others.
                  It also features comments from people with accounts and profile pictures, which also really surprised me.
