                    I chose Sunday to do my day without my phone (for the most part). My exception was that I used it to get in and out of my house, as I have to unlock the lobby door via an app. Overall, it was not as hard as I dreaded it to be. I started at 9 am, and at first I kept itching to text people or go on TikTok. But, by 9 p.m, it wasn’t hard to stay off my phone at all. What might’ve helped with this was the fact that I had a busy day of doing an assignment on my computer. I was working on a pretty tough cosmology assignment. Normally, though, I would plan to do homework and read, write, and clean, but the hobbies would be overtaken by my screentime. Today was very productive, and this challenge left me thinking that I should do this more often. I finally got around to continuing my Carl Jung book, which I have been meaning to do for months. At almost halfway through, you’d think it wouldn’t feel like such a heavy task, especially because I used to consider myself an avid reader. Before social media sites became so enticing to me, I could spend a fourth of my day just reading. I would come home from highschool, pick up a book, and be unable to put it down. But nowadays I keep checking my phone every 10-20 minutes. It was nice to allow myself to become absorbed by reading again. I cleaned my room, which I usually do a bit of when I plan to, but I also wrote poetry, and even spent the rest of my hours working on my poetry website, as I made an exception for my computer since I don’t go on social media or reply to messages on there. I also forbid myself from watching any shows, movies, or Youtube as well. I didn’t expect myself to say this, but I think that this is something that I want to try to do at least every Sunday.
