                    This website suprised me when I found it, but as someone who likes to follow politics, I found it interesting.
                    This site specifically follows military corruption. 
                    There are articles on the home page. 
                    There are also explanatory sections.
                    Founders introduces you to the background of the making of the site, and military swamp to why the site is important.
                    Discharges explains how military discharges work, and reports general reports that have been done on the military.
                    Confidentiality assures you that whistle blowers are kept anonymous, and disclaimer that the site has good, but heavy, intentions.
                    Finally, there is a section to donate.
