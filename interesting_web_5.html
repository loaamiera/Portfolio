                  This is a website where one can make an rgb color.
                  This website stood out to me because sometimes when I am making a site, I have a really specific color in mind.
                  Here, I can just click a section in the color gradient and receive the rgb for it.
                  It allows me to bypass looking through several charts, or being confined to one shade of a color such as color: green.
